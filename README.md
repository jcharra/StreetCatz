StreetCatz
==========

A simple 2d game implemented with Python and PyGame in 2008.


Story
=====

There are all those hungry cats out there, doesn't anyone take care of them ... yes, YOU do. Get into that car and
drop off food in the right places to attract felines. The first moment all of them are happy, the level is done.

Requirements
============

You need to have Python and Pygame installed. I don't remember exactly which version of Python/Pygame it was back then,
I think sth like v1.6 and probably Python 2.6. With a bit of luck it'll work with newer versions as well.

Gameplay
========

You have a monitor in the lower left corner of your display indicating cat positions and respective hunger intensity
(red denotes a very hungry specimen). Keys:

 Arrow Keys - Control car/avatar
 C          - get into/off the car
 SPACE      - Drop food
